# Formula 1 Data Visualisations 🏎️

Welcome to my Formula 1 Data Visualisations project! This repository contains various visualisations built using a **Formula 1 dataset** in **Tableau**. I have created a series of interactive dashboards and charts to explore the data and uncover insights related to the world of Formula 1 racing.

## 📑 Overview

This project showcases different types of data visualisations, including:

- **Treemaps** 🌳
- **Bar Charts** 📊
- **Pie Charts** 🥧
- **Bubble Charts** 🫧
- **Stacked Bar Charts** 📈

In addition to the visualisations, I’ve also incorporated **calculated fields** to enhance the analysis and provide more meaningful insights.



## 📊 Visualisations

Here are some of the types of visualisations I created:

###  **Treemaps** 🌳

Treemaps are used to visually represent hierarchical data. I used treemaps to show the distribution of total podiums scored by each driver across all the seasons.

###  **Pie Charts** 🥧

Pie charts were used to show the proportion of total points by each driver to their team in comparison to their teammate . They give a clear picture of how the points are distributed.

###  **Bubble Charts** 🫧

Bubble charts were used to visualise relationships between different variables. The size of each bubble represents the magnitude of a variable, making it easy to spot trends.

### **Stacked Bar Charts** 📈

Stacked bar charts were created to compare the performance of drivers across different teams they had raced for over time, showing how each team contributed to the total points.

## ⚙️ Calculated Fields

To enhance the analysis, I created several **calculated fields** in Tableau, including:

- **Total Number Of Podiums**: Counts the number of times each driver recorded a finish within the top 3 within a race.
- **Pole Positions**: Ranks drivers based on amount of first places in qualifying before the race.


## 🏁 Conclusion

In this project, I've used **Tableau** to explore and visualise a Formula 1 dataset, offering insights into the performance of drivers and teams over time. The combination of **interactive visualisations**—including treemaps, bar charts, pie charts and bubble charts—makes it easy to understand the dynamics of the sport, from the distribution of points across teams to individual driver performance.

By using **calculated fields**, I was able to add deeper analysis, such as tracking the number of fastest laps and ranking drivers based on key performance metrics. The project provides a comprehensive and engaging way to explore the exciting world of Formula 1.

Looking ahead, there are many opportunities for expanding and enhancing the analysis—such as incorporating more race seasons, adding further calculated fields and refining the interactive experience. I hope these visualisations provide both a clear understanding of the data and spark further interest in the sport and its statistics.

Thanks for exploring this project! 🏎️💨
